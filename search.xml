    <title>Kobe&#39;s Muse</title>
    <url>/2021/09/19/Kobe&#39;s%20Muse/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Muse, in the Greek context, means “freedom”, “poetry” and “inspiration”.</p>
<hr>
Young Kobe Bryant is
Difficult score
Super wide fadeaway jumper
Long strides to the baseline backhand Slam Dunk
He was angry and bared his teeth
As Bryant said, at that time, he always played with anger, not anger against opponents, but with himself, in order to force the bloodthirsty black mamba out of his body.
<span id="more"></span>
When we think of the man, we naturally conjure up an image of him as competitive and angular.
It's hard to find a second player in NBA history who's been so reviled.
For those who started watching basketball around 2000, Jordan's greatness can be seen in old videos and highlights, but for this young fan, Jordan is like a poster on the wall, perfect, but far away, like a myth.
Bryant's peak career overlapped with the technological explosion of the new century, and his every move and every word was besieged by media and social networks.
What we see, then, is an omnidirectional, three-dimensional, magnifying view of Bryant, whose every word is amplified, puffed up, or misinterpreted.
He is loved by many, he is blackened by all nations.
It's like every fan knows him, loves him, hates him.
His sick data, his scandal.
His cold-blooded killing, his blacksmithing as usual.
Really, it's like we all know him.
His stats, his "L.A. at 4 a.m." and "Crash before I crash" stories.
We can see this man every day or two on TV, even a little accustomed to, even if he is dictatorial to cut a high score, or refresh our impression of striking iron, even the mountain difference of five, really are a little accustomed to.
Until he got hurt.
The "Super Man", the "Iron Man", the "iron Man" who has been grinding attendance for several seasons.
What?
He's 35, 6 years old?
Retired?
Kobe, retirement?
You must be kidding!
But the fact is, he's actually talking about retirement, privately and publicly.
There is always a strong sense of unreality in seeing him in front of a crowd of microphones talking about how long he will be talking
Yeah, like a lifetime ago
Why is that?
Because he has done it in front of us too many times,he can,he always can.
4 consecutive 50+, 81-point, N +1 win, 5 championships...
But what about the sixth?
He has given us so much, but we just ask for more,and more.
We can no longer tell whether he is a laker or he is a laker, as if this man will always be around as long as the Lakers are around.
Until:
On April 13, 2013, In a game against the Golden State Warriors, Bryant rushed forward and fell to the ground with three injuries, looking pained.
Especially when the game is coming to an end that fall on the ground of the most deadly, when Bryant breakthrough foul the basket has slipped to the ground, see his hand over your knee pain, then Bryant insisted that punishment after the two goals, limping walked back to the locker room, Bryant was diagnosed with the left ankle ligament tear, it is "Peter pan" career one of the worst injuries.
"
After the game, Bryant was on crutches, choked up in an interview, his frustration, his inability to cope with the sudden injury, his red eyes, his throat tightened.
The surgery, the long recovery.
It's easy to imagine how hard it must be for a competitive, paranoid guy to endure not being able to play, run, or jump, all those days and nights.
He was so competitive, how he put up with it, and hearing about the younger guys doing amazing things and even hearing about the OTHER guys winning the O 'Brien Cup.
He said that the scar is a man's medal, to see it, as if to see his own journey, he was full of gratitude.
At this time, watching him in front of the camera talking about the past, father, lonely childhood, love and marriage, rookie season, OK group, climax, undervaluation, injuries, suffering, more highlights of the moment...
I suddenly understood the meaning of the word Muse
---- freedom, poetry and inspiration]]></content>

    <title>二次函数错题</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>二次函数<br>1.二次函数y=x(1-x)-2的一次项系数是      (二次函数的概念）</p>
<p>2.中国的新冠疫苗收到世界各国的高度认可，中国人民免费接种，但对国外要收取费用。已知出口某国的疫苗原价是400元/剂，每周可出口400000剂，在该国恳请对其优惠的条件下，每剂的售价降低10元，每周可多出口100000剂，设出口疫苗的销售收入为y元，销售价格为x元/剂，则y与x之间的函数表达式为                   .（根据实际数量与条件列出表达式）<br>3.将二次函数y=(x-7/4)^2-2的图像向上平移m个单位得到二次函数y2的图像，且与二次函数y1=(x+2)^2-4的图像交于点A，过A作x轴的平行线分别交y1,y2于点B,C,当AC=1/2*BA时，m的值是             .<br>(二次函数的图像及其特征，二次函数平移类问题）</p>
<p>4.在平面直角坐标系中，二次函数图像的顶点是A，与x轴交于B,C两点，与y轴交于点D,点B的坐标是（1,0）.平移该二次函数的图像，使点D恰好落在点A的位置上，求平移后图像所对应的二次函数的表达式.</p>
<p>5.已知二次函数与都有最小值，记、的最小值分别为m、n.<br>(1)若m+n=0,求证：对任意的实数x，都有+;<br>(2)若m、n均大于0，且mn=2,记M为m、n中的较大者，求m的最小值.</p>
<p>6.在中小企业对口扶贫的活动中，企业甲将一种经营状态良好的产品销售权以5.8万元的优惠价转让给尚有5万元无息贷款且无力偿还的小厂乙，约定从该产品经营的利润中，首先保证乙厂职工每月3600元的最低生活费开支后，逐步偿还转让费（不计息）.企业甲提供的产品为14元/件，月销量y（百件）与销售价x（元/件）之间的关系如图所示（两条线段）.经营该种产品每月需各种开支2000元.<br>(1)当产品销售价为多少时，每月的利润中扣除职工最低生活费后的余额最大？最大余额为多少？<br>(2)若乙厂仅靠该种产品经营的利润来脱贫，至少要多少年？</p>
<p>7.若抛物线与四条直线围成的正方形有公共点，则的取值范围是                 .</p>
<p>8.某一房间内，A、B两点之间设有探测报警装置，小车（不计大小）在房间内运动，当小车从A、B之间经过时，将触发报警。现将A、B两点放置于平面直角坐标系xOy中，已知点A,B的坐标分别为（0,4）（4,4），小车沿抛物线运动.若小车在运动过程中只触发一次报警装置，则a的取值范围是                          .</p>
<p>9.在平面直角坐标系中,点O(0,0),点A(1,0).已知抛物线，顶点为P.无论m取何值，该抛物线都经过定点H.当°时，抛物线的解析式是</p>
