    <content><![CDATA[<p>Muse, in the Greek context, means “freedom”, “poetry” and “inspiration”.<br><br><br>Young Kobe Bryant is<br>Difficult score<br>Super wide fadeaway jumper<br>Long strides to the baseline backhand Slam Dunk<br>He was angry and bared his teeth<br>As Bryant said, at that time, he always played with anger, not anger against opponents, but with himself, in order to force the bloodthirsty black mamba out of his body.</p>

<p>When we think of the man, we naturally conjure up an image of him as competitive and angular.<br>It’s hard to find a second player in NBA history who’s been so reviled.<br>For those who started watching basketball around 2000, Jordan’s greatness can be seen in old videos and highlights, but for this young fan, Jordan is like a poster on the wall, perfect, but far away, like a myth.<br>Bryant’s peak career overlapped with the technological explosion of the new century, and his every move and every word was besieged by media and social networks.<br>What we see, then, is an omnidirectional, three-dimensional, magnifying view of Bryant, whose every word is amplified, puffed up, or misinterpreted.<br>He is loved by many, he is blackened by all nations.<br>It’s like every fan knows him, loves him, hates him.<br>His sick data, his scandal.<br>His cold-blooded killing, his blacksmithing as usual.<br>Really, it’s like we all know him.<br>His stats, his “L.A. at 4 a.m.” and “Crash before I crash” stories.<br>We can see this man every day or two on TV, even a little accustomed to, even if he is dictatorial to cut a high score, or refresh our impression of striking iron, even the mountain difference of five, really are a little accustomed to.<br>Until he got hurt.<br>The “Super Man”, the “Iron Man”, the “iron Man” who has been grinding attendance for several seasons.<br>What?<br>He’s 35, 6 years old?<br>Retired?<br>Kobe, retirement?<br>You must be kidding!<br>But the fact is, he’s actually talking about retirement, privately and publicly.<br>There is always a strong sense of unreality in seeing him in front of a crowd of microphones talking about how long he will be talking<br>Yeah, like a lifetime ago<br>Why is that?<br>Because he has done it in front of us too many times,he can,he always can.<br>4 consecutive 50+, 81-point, N +1 win, 5 championships…<br>But what about the sixth?<br>He has given us so much, but we just ask for more,and more.<br>We can no longer tell whether he is a laker or he is a laker, as if this man will always be around as long as the Lakers are around.<br>Until:<br>On April 13, 2013, In a game against the Golden State Warriors, Bryant rushed forward and fell to the ground with three injuries, looking pained.<br>Especially when the game is coming to an end that fall on the ground of the most deadly, when Bryant breakthrough foul the basket has slipped to the ground, see his hand over your knee pain, then Bryant insisted that punishment after the two goals, limping walked back to the locker room, Bryant was diagnosed with the left ankle ligament tear, it is “Peter pan” career one of the worst injuries.<br>“<br>After the game, Bryant was on crutches, choked up in an interview, his frustration, his inability to cope with the sudden injury, his red eyes, his throat tightened.<br>The surgery, the long recovery.<br>It’s easy to imagine how hard it must be for a competitive, paranoid guy to endure not being able to play, run, or jump, all those days and nights.<br>He was so competitive, how he put up with it, and hearing about the younger guys doing amazing things and even hearing about the OTHER guys winning the O ‘Brien Cup.<br>He said that the scar is a man’s medal, to see it, as if to see his own journey, he was full of gratitude.<br>At this time, watching him in front of the camera talking about the past, father, lonely childhood, love and marriage, rookie season, OK group, climax, undervaluation, injuries, suffering, more highlights of the moment…<br>I suddenly understood the meaning of the word Muse<br>—- freedom, poetry and inspiration</p>
